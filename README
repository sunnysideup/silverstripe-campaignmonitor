CampaignMonitor Module
Pre 0.1 proof of concept
###############################################

Developer
-----------------------------------------------
Nicolaas Francken [at] sunnysideup.co.nz

Requirements
-----------------------------------------------
SilverStripe 2.3.0 or greater.

Documentation
-----------------------------------------------
see:
 http://silverstripe-webdevelopment.com/campaignmonitor

Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module at all, but instead customise
it from your mysite folder, so that you can upgrade the module without redoing the settings.


Synchronisation options
-----------------------------------------------

--- MUST DO FIRST ---
1. create list on CM
2. identify list as THE list for synchronisation
(there could be more than one list)
3. group on silverstripe that represents that list in CM

--- WHAT CAN BE DONE ---
1. subscribe: member is added to group and added to CM list
2. unsubscribe: member is removed from list and unsubscribed from CM list
3. synchronise: group membership is emptied and all members on CM list
who are also Members in SilverStripe will be added to group in SilverStripe
